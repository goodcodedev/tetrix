Vimtris/rainbow-ui development
---
This was the development of [vimtris](http://vimtris.com), a tetris clone using vim keys.
After this development, the generic code got it's own repository on [rainbow-ui](https://github.com/codewaterlabs/rainbow-ui), while the vimtris game code was put in [another repository](https://github.com/codewaterlabs/vimtris).
Both codebases have gotten a few commits after this.
